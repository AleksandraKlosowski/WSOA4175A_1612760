            Ironically in a world that focuses on creating the luxury of instant connectivity 
            with tools that assist in being able to connect and communicate from across the globe, 
            we have become the most 'disconnected' generation. In connecting via social media, we have
            become ever so anti-social in the real world. With this luxury, social anxiety grows 
            and people rely on artificial/inauthentic forms of communication.
