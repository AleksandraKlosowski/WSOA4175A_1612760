                <h2>Net and Web Art:</h2>
                <p>
                This critical analysis will be focused on a digital web art piece entitled: Indirect Flight by Joe
                Hamilton. I will be looking at literary readings such as Walter Benjamin’s, “The Work of Art
                in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936) whereby he states that a reproduction of an
                image is publically more valuable than the original.
                </p>
                <p>
                This website explores art through a multi-layered topography in reference to digital map
                navigation apps such as Waze and Google Maps. The layers incorporate various natural
                textures and a ‘scroll animation’ that enables the layers to move at different speeds from
                the base layer (the satellite images). This prevents the artwork from being a simple collage
                with three-dimensional images and provides viewers with a genuine 3D experience.
                Interestingly, it is through this scroll animated movement and layering that equally provides
                a certain two-dimensional feel as the cut-out of the layer is emphasized. Users are able to
                scroll and move in any direction on the site, whereby the art loops and creates the
                impression that the website is limitless. This is perhaps alluding to navigating around the
                globe. The globes is round and therefore, despite only having a certain amount of surface
                area, one will never reach an edge/end as one would eventually reach the same location;
                demonstrated by the websites choice to loop the artwork. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Referring back to Benjamin’s article, the social importance of a duplicated artwork is far
                more effective. This is arguably because far more individuals have access to the artwork.
                Despite his views that replications somewhat devalue the artworks exclusiveness/originality,
                it has been revolutionary in its influence as of the late 20th Century Movements and opens
                the artistic world into a new era of artistic expression (Benjamin in David Carrier 2020).
                Hamilton’s web art is a unique and valuable despite this. This is done through the use of
                copied images, accessible to anyone whereby various individuals can use the images at their
                disposal. Hamilton has found new and innovative ways in creating a unique sense of artistic
                expression and overall a unique artwork despite having used materials that everyone has
                seen before. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Net art is effectively a combination of conventional digital design and collaborative user
                experience (Park 2007 pg 1). This provides artists with a unique sense of empowerment due
                to the art forms limitlessness. Park argues that in summation, Net/Web art is simply based
                around user interaction (Park 2007 pg 8). This creates an engaged and responsive user
                experience, whereby the user can actively take part in the artistic experience. In Hamilton’s
                artwork; without the user, the artwork is incomplete. It is through the users scrolling and
                exploring of the website that reveals the artwork; without the user it would simply be an
                image collage on a screen. “Art and lift the user up on majority position, and allow user to
                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, despite Hamilton being the sole creature of this digital artwork; it is through a
                unique collaborative experience between the artist and the viewer that results in a
                stimulating, modern approach to art. This results in a unique form of engagement that has
                not been experienced in more traditional forms of art whether digital or analog.

            <h2>Core Principle of Design and Aesthetics in the Web:</h2>
            <p>
            This blogpost will be looking at the core principles of design and aesthetic in terms of the web and 
            the way an artist chooses to introduce these components. It will also be exploring why and how these 
            components determine the overall sensation experienced by its viewers. It is through the works by Lisbeth Thorlacius, 
            Nielson and Yong Park that we will explore these elements and ultimately how the success of a website relies on a websites 
            design and aesthetic elements.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is a large difference between Web Design and Web Aesthetics. Web Aesthetic refers to the visual elements 
            of a website or other forms of digital representation. This often includes the way in which a designer implements layout 
            components such as menus, images, fonts etc. “The only thing we cannot avoid is that there is always visual communication 
            on a website, whether the use of visual effects is deliberate or not.” (Thorlacius, 2007) Although one cannot avoid the 
            use of visual elements, we have control as to how we choose to use and introduce these elements.
            </p>
            <p>
            Alternatively, Web Design holds a greater focus on user experience properties. This determines how user friendly the 
            website is; ultimately this is the communication between the viewer and the website/app itself (Jakob Nielsen 2012). As 
            explained by Ji Yong Park, Net art allows developers to “bridge the gap between traditional graphic design and interactive 
            user experience in that it has empowered the users to be an interactive artist” (2007 pg1). This suggests that without a 
            spectator there is no art.
            </p>
            <p>
            One can argue that these two components are equally the most important when designing a website and web art; essentially 
            this determines whether or not the viewers engage with the work as intended (Thorlacius, 2007).
            </p>
            <p>
            According to Yong Park, Net Art is typically a creation that uses easily accessible materials to others online (2007 pg3), 
            making it somewhat difficult to create a truly ‘unique’ work. It is the artist’s job to use these materials and implement 
            them in new, innovative ways that introduce viewers to something interesting and original despite the use of ‘borrowed’ 
            materials. It is the hidden elements of the website that places everything together and creates the end result that is displayed 
            to  the viewer; this being the code. Without the code, the artwork would not be displayed as this determines how the site is run, 
            how the elements are displayed and how the functionality is implemented, “invisible and hidden elements behind the screen can be 
            considered as important as a visual outcome in art.” (Heemskerk & Paesmans in Yong Park 2007 pg3).
            </p>
            <p>
            In conclusion, the successfulness of web art is determined by the overall interactivity between the viewer and the website, as 
            without a viewer, web art cannot be considered art. Therefore Web Aesthetics and Web Design hold great importance in creating a 
            unique experience for the viewer. Together they create and determine a viewer’s engagement and its success for its respective 
            target audience.

            <h2>Internet, Society and Design Justice:</h2>
            <p>
            This weeks’ blogpost will be elaborating on the core issues around the Internet, Society and Design Justice for the web.
            </p> 
            <p>
            According to Constanza-Chock (2020, pg23): as designers, we have an moral responsibility in creating an all-inclusive design/digital community, specifically by targeting historically marginalized groups with their involvement in the community. Constanza-Chock also looks at and elaborates on ‘Design Justice’; this being the dismantling of organized inequality whether by race, gender or sexual association.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only is this important for creating an ethical and cohesive community, but being an artistic field, it is important to have a wide spread of creative expression and expanding on the limitations of one community. The integration of various individuals allows for new and intuitive expressions that expand the digital world of art through “diasporic design traditions, knowledge, and practices” (Constanca-Chock 2022, pg18).
            </p>
            <p>
            Nanjira Sambuli strives for equality in the digital age; her aims are to shorten the inequality gap in the digital world. This can include things as simple as facial recognition technology. Such technology is equipped ideally for the Caucasian male whereby it is not as responsive to women and even less so with other races. Equally cell phone designs are constructed around the size of an average males’ hand. These are of the smaller issues around inequality in the digital world as opposed to a pay gap and overall lack of representation.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nanjira states that only half of the world has access to the internet (2019) with less focus on access to these individuals. Most affected populations and communities include the poorer populations and women depending on cultural standards and expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
            Arguably, accessibility to the digital world is incredibly important. It allows people to connect and progress with the rest of the world without being left behind. Society is entering a large digital era whereby dependability is starting to largely rely on the digital world; without cohesive connectivity and basic technological understandings, there is the expansion of an economical gap.
            </p>
            <p>
            Not only is work starting to largely depend on digital capabilities, the spreading of news and vital information is instantaneous.
            </p>
            <p>
            Nanjira believes that it is therefore our societal duty to provide and work towards expanding on technological access to all communities. An example of such a framework would include the design justice network and their strife for sharing resources and by dismantling a suppressive system. This includes the involvement of various community based design and the active involvement and participation of various groups.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
            This quarter I have engaged in various theoretical frameworks including Internet Art and its history. This involves the understandings of Social and Design Justice in this respective field as well as an overall understanding as to what makes web and net art successful. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I feel that I have engaged appropriately with the topic in a way that prepares me for entering our field in an open state of mind and a new approach to future projects. I now have a new understanding of the digital community and the tremendous lengths that we still face in order to have an ideal industry in terms of multi-faceted involvement. Social factors aside, it is through their enforcement that we effectively create more meaningful and engaging art, as the involvement of new perspectives allows for innovative and interesting approaches to the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have chosen to use foundation colours such as black and white. Specifically being that this site will display works of art that rotate monthly; therefore it looks far sleeker to use monochromatic css as to not clash with any artworks.
                Using Black and White in itself often reads as professional to viewers. I have used a peach colour for the navigation bar however to introduce an element of visual stimulation that grabs the viewers attention.
                The wireframes that I have designed have not yet been implemented in full; this is due to the fact that my website is somewhat in the earlier stages of development 
                and will be gradually introduced through development. My designs are sleek, structured and simple as to not overwhelm the viewer, appear to a variety of audiences (as older audiences may become confused with a more
                creative layout) and to maintain the idea that this is a professional environment much like a gallery, where the gallery is simple but the work speaks for itself.
